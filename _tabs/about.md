Hello there!! I am 0bssy, and this is my blog where i upload hacking content like CTF's, Write-ups and Web Vulnerabilites. I am a Cybersecurity student that likes the way on how to trick systems to do things there not intended to do, some times we are blind, and we don't see it coming. There will be some Cheat Sheet's too, so you don't get overwhelmed with some content.

Why i created this blog?
 - I like to teach some knowledge to people
 - I will be using this blog to see how long we can get
 - Use the blog like a portfolio


That been said, continue into hacking!! ;)
