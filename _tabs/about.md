Hi, I am Sonu George. Welcome to my personal website where I mostly blog
about Data, Technology, Personal Finance and other things that interest me.

I am based out of the East Coast and work for a startup based out of California. I have been in the data space for a little over a decade and in engineering the past 7 years.
