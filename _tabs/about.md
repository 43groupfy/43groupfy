## Hello! My name is Amirreza Taghizadeh.

<font size="3px">
I love video games, especially NPC Ai. I code in C# (Unity) and C++.
</font>


### Academic Background
<font size='3px'>
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from AmirKabir University. I am interested in Linear Algebra. I also like optimization algorithms such as Network Simplex and Branch-and-Bound to solve MIP models for VRP in sea ports.
</font>

### Games Research
<font size='3px'>
My main research interest is NPC Ai. I am currently studying a project conducted by W. Alenezi & C. Verbrugge. It is a Unity stealth game, proposing a new strategy for NPC pathfinding in Stealth games based on a skeleton based approach.

### Games Developed
<font size='3px'>
I have developed a runner casual game, which is basically the amalgamation of Subway Surfers with limiting playerâ€™s Field of View. We aim to make it endless and implement Dynamic Difficulty techniques.<br />
My next goal is to develop a stealth game to employ techniques used by Mr. Alenezi and test it with similar approaches used in Third Eye Crime game.
