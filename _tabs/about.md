As artificial intelligence and language models revolutionise various sectors, their potential within the realm of social sciences remains largely untapped. Our 3-day workshop aims to bridge this divide, introducing early career social scientists to the transformative potential of language models, from powering Internet search engines to acting as sophisticated personal assistants.

This event is designed to demystify these technologies, demonstrating their immense potential to enhance research in the social sciences. It will provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of language models, their functionality, strengths, limitations, and the crucial considerations necessary for their effective utilisation.

The workshop will comprise daily sessions featuring 3-hour lectures on language models, 3-hour coding tutorials, and guest speaker presentations. Additionally, it will offer a platform for participants to present their own research to an expert panel, encouraging enriching discussions and collaborative learning. By promoting such innovation, we aim to advance the adoption of these complex tools in social science research.
