### ðŸ”» Introduction
___

I am Mark Pierce, born in the United States, grew up in the United Kingdom and currently reside in the Netherlands. I was a military kid growing up so I've managed to live in Germany, Belgium, London and a couple of States in America. I am a military veteran and a United States Marine.

Between exploring Amsterdam and giving my dog far more attention than any one creature should need, my second passion is Hiking and camping. I am also an advid runner taking part in Marathons and trail running.

I was a system engineer/administrator by trade, but recently I've moved into a more Cloud-Native, git-ops orientated role where I am now a Site Reliability Engineer.


### ðŸ”» Background
___

I was not born with the natural ability to grasp and solve problems quickly. I need to work hard in an effort to make up for this. Yet, I've learned that this approach to learning, and those with a similar story have a few things in common when knowing this information about ourselves. We seek knowledge and those that are more knowledgeable as resources and assets, we need to be honest and forthright towards others about ourselves. Fortunately, I have managed to take what I do for work and turn it into a hobby with building out a homelab environment.

As a kid I always remember having a PC in the house. My first computer memories are living in Germany and the family buying an Apple IIgs and playing games like Leisure Suit Larry and wishing I could type with blazing fast speed. These are the moments when I started to slowly realize what it is I wanted to do later in life. Fast forward to me being a teenager and randomly deleting things in the system32 folder on Windows 95, my father figured it was now time for me to leave the poor family PC alone and get my own ~~sandbox~~ computer.

### ðŸ”» Closing
___

I have included a version of my resume on the site if you're looking for an engineer and I encourage you to reach out. If you liked something please hit me up on Linkedin, Github or through email. Growing up with the internet and being part of internet communities, meeting strangers and sharing stories is what makes this whole experience enjoyable.

We grow better with others.
