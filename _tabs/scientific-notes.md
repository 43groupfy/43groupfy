[_Scientific Notes_](https://github.com/Booodaness/Scientific-Notes) is a collaboration on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for maintaining open-source notes on mathematical physics, physics and mathematics. I originally started the project to make my local notes accessible whether or not they are later assimilated into blog posts on this site. However, it soon became standalone, with a different workflow. Primarily, the notes in the repository are more dynamic, while the blog focuses more on the ease to follow up. Since collaboration is dynamic, _Scientific Notes_ is better suited for writing, while the blog is typically friendlier to read.

The experience of writing notes together should be as simple as possible, so that authors and readers can focus more on the content. To meet this end, we use the beautiful, free and open-source application [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Briefly put, Obsidian lets users build a knowledge base using local Markdown files and the power of hypertext. It also offers high extensibility through hundreds of powerful plugins. This lets one do a variety of things, from [drawing diagrams](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) and [typesetting LaTeX at high speed](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite), to [syncing the notes via Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git).

The features of Obsidian are too many to put here, so it's time for some pictures to speak the words:

The elegant features of Obsidian increased my productivity considerably not only when it came to taking down mathematical notes, but also analyzing them deeply. In general, I would highly recommend the application to anyone who intends to make digital notes on complex, interconnected topics.

That said, the very personalized approach of Obsidian may get in the way of collaboration, since each contributor, in all probability, has a very unique way of making notes on a particular topic. To deal with this, we simply have independent 'pools' that authors make their own notes in. One can think of the root directory of _Scientific Notes_ as a library, with different sections corresponding to different authors. Apart from such pools, there is also a common pool where authors can directly collaborate on notes.

Contributions from any and every person are respected, and individual pools are not encouraged to be changed without pull requests, unless the changed pool is one's own. Any change is accompanied by remarks and discussion to ensure that there is no conflict of interests.

All in all, _Scientific Notes_, like _Tempus Spatium_, is an experiment for exploring theoretical physics and mathematics. Feel free to visit [the project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Booodaness/Scientific-Notes) to star it, read it on your computer or contribute to it!
