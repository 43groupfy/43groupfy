announcement: "Readers may have noticed my recent absence. The primary reason for it is that I am beginning my university life at the University of Waterloo. It will take a little time to get accustomed to the schedule and post to the blog more regularly. That said, another reason for my temporary absence is that I am learning a lot of new things through some amazing people and working on broadening my understanding of mathematical physics. I have a layout in mind for future posts and hope to begin materializing it this November. Stay tuned and take care!"
