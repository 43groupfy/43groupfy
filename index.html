announcement: "Readers may have noticed my recent absence. The primary reason for it is that I am beginning my university life at the University of Waterloo. It will take a little time to get accustomed to the schedule and reach a state of efficiency which will permit me to regularly write detailed blog posts. That said, another reason for my temporary absence is that I am learning a lot of new things and trying to broaden my understanding of mathematical physics. I have a layout for future posts in mind and hopefully they will be materialized this November. Stay tuned and take care!"
