    <p>### Project Description<br>
    The healthcare sector is currently facing a significant issue concerning data governance, particularly in relation to
    health equity and Ethical AI/ML issues impacting minority populations. This challenge is exacerbated by the lack of
    robust partnerships and coordination between key stakeholders, leading to gaps in data sharing, access control,
    regulatory policies, and oversight.<br>
    <br>
    The need for capacity building and training of informatics personnel, as well as the integration of bioethics experts
    with informaticians, is also a pressing concern.<br>
    <br>
    Our project aims to develop a concerted effort between two partner institutes (Tuskegee University and UTHealth at
    Houston) to strengthen data governance and facilitate the adoption of AI/ML technologies, while ensuring the ethical
    treatment and representation of minority populations.</p>
