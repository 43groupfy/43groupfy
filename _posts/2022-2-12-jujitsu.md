Similar patterns decades apart. I once joined a karate club as a teenager. During the break, I would find myself discussing comics, collectibles, and computer games. I recently joined a jujitsu class to get out of my computer chair and have a physical exercise (as best as I can as I age). Habits won’t change… once again, during the break, I would talk to others. Most of them are kids. Now you find yourself talking with them about NFTs (kids mainly want to build their own), crypto (confusion arises when you tell them to secure their coins), and console games. One thing that struck me though. Whenever you ask them about college plans, they would frown and say “maybe business”. It seems that the word “business” is becoming a catch-all phrase as “I am not even thinking about college or I don’t know about college. I want to make money now”.
