My wife and I immigrated to the United States in 2001 to have a better quality of life. We are fortunate to have built a family of our own here in the US and became part of its society as American citizens. What hurts is hearing news about those families that lost their lives and their children when trying to reach the United States in any way possible to escape poverty. The world can be truly unfair.
