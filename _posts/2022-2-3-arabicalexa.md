Amazon Alexa learns Arabic. The article goes through the challenges and the steps that made it happen. The data scientists focused on spoken Arabic, which is an important step in enabling more AI projects in the Arab world that all share one written Arabic language but multiple spoken dialects. If only my kids (and me) would learn our second language well. I wish we have more human dialogues in such a beautiful language that is facing major challenges in keeping up with the next generation of Arabs communicating more frequently and very easily using predominantly English-centric digital devices.
