The first ever school on Large Language Models for Social Science (Oxford) happend in September 2023. We were lucky to have huge interest in the workshop and were joined by around 30 exceptionally qualified and excited participants. 
The event brought together PhD students and postdocs from around the world, all eager to explore advanced text analysis and AI for social science. 

# School Conveiners 

[Dr. Elena Voita](https://lena-voita.github.io/), a brilliant Research Scientist at FAIR (Meta AI), and [Ilya Boytsov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ieboytsov/), the NLP lead at Wayfair led the school's lectures and workshops respectively. 
Dr. Voita's lectures took us on an enlightening journey through the evolution of NLP, from rule-based systems to modern Transformer models and culminating in model alignment techniques.

Meanwhile, Ilya Boytsov's practical coding tutorials were packed with industry insights and tips, giving participants a real-world perspective on deploying language models. 
Despite the challenges, including visa issues that prevented Ilya from attending in person, he conducted cyberpunk-like hybrid workshops, teaching online to a live audience, and the sessions remained an unforgettable learning experience.

# Open Source Materials

To ensure that the knowledge gained extended beyond the event, we created the website you are currently viewing and a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/antndlcrx/oxford-llms-workshop). These platforms became the central hubs for all workshop materials, including lecture notes, coding exercises, and presentation slides (and soon to be videos!). By making these resources publicly accessible, we aim to allow a wider audience benefit from the workshop. 

# Looking Ahead
The success of the 2023 summer school has set a high bar for the future. We're already planning improvements based on the invaluable feedback we received. With exciting new content and enhanced logistics, the next workshop promises to be at least as good as the one before (hopefully even better!). 

Keep an eye on our website and GitHub repository for updates and access to our extensive collection of resources!
