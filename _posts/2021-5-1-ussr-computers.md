Most history books on computers focus on the Western movements that lead to the advancement and breakthroughs in the field. However, the Russians during the Soviet Union era had their internal research and development that was not generally well known outside their circle. Luckily, the Russian Virtual Museum now provides a window on the computers made by the Soviets during the 60s, such as the Minsk family of computers.
