Electronic computers were born out of IBM vacuum tubes like the Westinghouse 6211 electronic tube below, nearly identical to the one used in the Univac computer in the 50s. The Univac (UNIVersal Automatic Computer I) was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer design for business applications produced in the United States by Eckert and Mauchly. It was used to predict the presidential election of Eisenhower in the 50s.
