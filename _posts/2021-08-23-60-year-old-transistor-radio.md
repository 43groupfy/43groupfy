Japan has always played a significant role in the development of computers and electronics. For the computer history passionate, such as myself, the Information Processing Society of Japan website is a gold mine for historical resources. Their computer museum at http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/index.html provides the development history of computers in Japan and its key pioneers. Recently, I grabbed a 60-year-old transistor radio, model 6516 7 Transistor made by Sanyo under the brand Channel Master Corp. it is so elegant both from the inside and outside. I havenâ€™t tested its capacitors yet.
