<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>"Many a mickle makes a muckle."</b></h4>

## In the beginning
My name is Qawam Musiliu, and I am learning to become a security researcher. It can be overwhelming to begin learning towards a career despite the myriad of resources within reach. 

To ease my learning journey, I realized it would be necessary to follow a definitive roadmap. I came across this awesome Github <a href= "https://github.com/HACKE-RC/awesome-reversing?" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">repository </a>and created a personalized version.

## On the Road to Damascus
This roadmap is ground zero. I won't be doing the cool stuff like malware reversing, vulnerability analysis, or exploiting yet. It will be enough to start writing simple C++ programs, debugging, disassembling, and making sense of decompiler outputs.

In the words of HackSultan, a prominent figure in African tech ecosystem,
"When it comes to your tech career progress, you have 3 options to get to your destination:

>1. You can get there fast and easy, but you won’t be really good.
>2. You can get there fast and be good, but it won't be easy.  
>3. You can get there slow and easy, and you’ll be good"

There is a great lot to learn not included in this roadmap. I will include them in the sequel to this article. I promise!

## The Scrolls will Guide You
I enjoy learning with books. Below are my recommendations:

1. <b>Operating Systems </b>
- Windows Internals Part 1 - Pavel Yosifovich, Mark E. Russinovich, Alex Ionescu, David A. Solomon
- How Linux Works - Brian Ward

2. <b>Assembly Language</b>
- x64 Assembly Language Step-by-Step Programming with Linux - Jeff Duntemann
- <a href="https://asmtutors.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">NASM x86 Assembly Language on Linux</a>

3. <b>C++ Programming</b>
- <a href="https://learncpp.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">learncpp.com</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/Rustam-Z/cpp-programming" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> CPP Programming</a>

## Chasing the First Highs
It is important to begin reversing at this point with the fundamental knowledge acquired from "Getting Started." Here on, you will get hands-on practice reversing with industry-standard tools, disassemblers, debuggers, decompilers, and perhaps your custom-made tools and scripts.

<b>Practice reversing simple C/C++ programs</b>
<p>The web platforms below are a goldmine for anyone learning to reverse. The Compiler Explorer helps to explore and understand the Assembly output of different high-level codes. The Decompiler Explorer shows equivalent C-like output of decompiled programs from popular decompilers.</p>

- <a href="https://dogbolt.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">dogbolt Decompiler Explorer</a>



<b>CTF Challenges (Reversing and Binary Exploitation)</b>
<p>Capture the flag (CTF) challenges are a great way to build reversing skills. Play occasionally. It is okay if you can't solve many tasks at first. Read writeups shared by other players to understand how the challenges are solved, tricks, and gain other people's perspectives.</p>

- <a href="https://ctftime.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CTFtime</a>

<b>LiveOverflow youtube videos</b>
<p>LifeOverflow has quality educational contents on his Youtube channel. He is quite a great teacher.</p>

<b>Solving simple crackme challenges</b>
<p>There are hundreds of crackmes on this site to practice your reverse engineering skills. These programs are categorized based on architecture (x86, x86-64, ARM), platform(Windows, Unix/Linux, Mac OS), and programming languages.</p>

## Light Out by Dusk
This learning path is tailored to align with my goals, preferences, and pace. I share this to give insight to help you design your own learning path. Subsequent articles will feature assembly programming projects, my solutions for competitive programming, CTF writeups, and more. 

Have fun learning.
