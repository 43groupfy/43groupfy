When I was a kid, my dad once told me that it is essential to work hard to rest later. During my youth, it never crossed my mind that resting later means at the end of oneâ€™s life. For me, to do your best means to be up there working or learning each day and all days while keeping a proper family life balance. Recently, I have noticed articles about how the new era is driving demand for working less. It might be suitable for some but not for all - at least not me. Working and wanting to do good things every day is what motivates me and makes me what I am. Have a happy working day!
