My latest retro-technology collection acquisition is an #ibm 1969 Hexapawn board game invented by Martin Gardner in perfect condition. Its headline is “the more you win, the more you lose when you ‘teach’ this game board to play Hexapawn.” It is the first machine learning game on cardboard game invented as a product. Several online games were later built based on their simple AI heuristic algorithm.
