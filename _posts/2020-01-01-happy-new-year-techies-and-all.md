On New Year 's Eve twenty years ago (the year 2000), I was at an accountant 's office watching over his servers and software to make sure the year 2000 would pass with no glitches. I previously did the software upgrades and carefully checked everything as the year 2000 trickled through the night. As technologists, we ensure customer satisfaction and systems availability year after year. It is also an important trait in developing technology leadership skills. Otherwise, what is the value of technology if the experience is broken? Happy new year, everyone and all the techies out there.
