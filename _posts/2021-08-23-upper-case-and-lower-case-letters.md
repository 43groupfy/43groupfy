Do you know why typing capital letters on a computer keyboard is commonly called “upper case” and small characters are called “lower case”? In the 18th century, letterpress printing was done on a wooden box where capital letters were stored in a separate drawer in the top part of the case, hence “upper case”, and the small letters were stored separately in the lower case drawer, “hence lower case.”
