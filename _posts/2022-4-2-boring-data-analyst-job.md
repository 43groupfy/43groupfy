A recent CNBC article, ["These are the 5 most ‘boring’ — and exciting — jobs in the world, according to a recent study"](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/22/these-are-the-top-5-most-boring-jobs-according-to-researchers.html) states that, based on university research, the number 1 most boring job is data analyst, the number 1 more exciting job is performing arts, and the number 1 most boring hobby is sleeping. Yet the data analyst job pays more, boring or not. I agree that sleeping is the most boring of all. I also believe that we do lots of great data-related activities at 1010data. We are hiring at 1010data, so check it out at [1010Data Careers](https://www.1010data.com/company/careers)
