Each time I ask bilingual (English + another language) students or professionals working on machine learning if they considered doing a project for their nonEnglish mother tongues language, such as Hindi or Spanish or Arabic, they would look surprised. Yes, there are many publications on all sorts of languages, but how often do you see innovative products in the market for non-English customers, even in English-speaking nations? The US has a vast immigration population and houses neighborhoods that donâ€™t even speak English. Why not develop more intelligent products with deep learning that targets nonEnglish recipients and not just come up with another translation software every time? We need to think beyond the status-quo of research, products, software, and predominately English publications. It is challenging, I admit, because it is so easy to code in English with an English programming language syntax, editor, OS, GUI, and it is also hard to find a nonEnglish corpus. Mandarin is an exception in all this here. All in all, it is not impossible to do more for nonEnglish speaking societies.
