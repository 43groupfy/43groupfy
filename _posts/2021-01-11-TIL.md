Finally I am starting write something on my new github blog. I thought it would be a good way to practice. Anyway, let's get started.

# Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server and native), and are easy to test. We can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It's tiny(just 2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosysyem of add-ons available.
