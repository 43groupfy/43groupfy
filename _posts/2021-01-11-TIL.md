Finally I am starting write something on my new github blog. I thought it would be a good way to practice. Anyway, let's get started.

# Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server and native), and are easy to test. We can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library. It's tiny(just 2kB, including dependencies), but has a large ecosysyem of add-ons available.
We need to know about the 3 main principles of Redux.
1. Single source of truth + Redux is a state conatainer, it stores    
   all of your state in one place
2. Changes are made with pure functions
3. State is read-only

#### 1
Redux supplies us a handy function called ```createStore()```
Here we create the store that will hold all our state.

#### 2 
State can only be changed by a pure function called a **reducer**. 
To create this connection we will pass in our reducer to createStor()
```var store = createStore(reducer)```
It gets more complicated when you have more reducers but at the core, the store now has a reducer attached to it.

#### 3 
Once we have a store that is created with store = createStore(reducer), the new store we created has a method called dispatch. Remember the only way we can change the state is to dispatch an action!
```store.dispatch(action)```

Following is a very basic and limited implementation of Redux's createStore(). 
```
**createStore** = (**reducer**) => {
  let **state**;
// dispatch method 
  **dispatch** = (**action**) => {
    **state** = **reducer(state, action)**
  }
  return {dispatch}
}
```
The reducer is passed in to the createStore and it becomes set in our dispatch method. And when we call the dispatch method it takes in an action and it sets a new state based on what reducer will return.

####What is a Reducer? What is an Action?
An Action at the most basic level is an object that has a property called type. It can also have other properties but for simplicity it will only have type.
```var someAction = {type:'doSomething'}

A reducer is just a function:
```
var reducer = (state, action) => {
    if (action.type === 'doSomething'){
        return changedState;
    } else if ( action.type === 'doSomethingElse'){
        return changedState;
    } else {
        return state
    }
}
```
The action that we pass into a reducer will determine how the state will be changed depending on the type.
Redux does get more complicated but if you understand these principles then we will have an easier time naviagting throught react-redux projects.
