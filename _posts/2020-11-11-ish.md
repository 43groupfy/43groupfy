Ish is an iOS (iPhone/iPad) app that emulates a complete x86 Alpine Linux operating system along with a package management tool. Your iOS turns into a full coding environment such as running Python scripts, using vim/emac editor, and pulling/pushing github code. I use it for my coding projects using an iPad mini with an external keyboard case. If you are a developer with an iPad, do check it out atÂ <a  target="_blank" href="https://ish.app/">ish.app</a>
