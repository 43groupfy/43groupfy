The 90s Internet was cool with sites that are now technically extinct. Some of you will remember Geocities, MySpace , AOL, and Yahoo! Answers. Others may remember AltaVista and Friendster. Thanks for Archive.Org Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org that can let us visit websites from the past.
