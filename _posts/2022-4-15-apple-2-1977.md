On Friday, April 15, 1977, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak showcased the Apple II at the first annual West Coast Computer Fair in San Francisco. Twelve thousand seven hundred fifty computer geeks were present. Some walked passed the Apple booth while many others gathered around the demos. Computer enthusiasts were accustomed at the time to build-your-computer kits, such as the first pc, the Altair 8800. Apple II came along and changed everything. It was an invention of the personal computer that came with as a whole with a keyboard, a monitor, color display, expansion slots, and a built-in programming language (BASIC) all in one. The technology industry and all its applications worldwide have never been the same ever since. No one and I would be typing on a smartphone or a computer right now if it was not for what Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak unveiled to the world on that day.
