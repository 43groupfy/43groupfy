The recent quarterly loss for Facebook is significant because it reflects the reality of where the customers genuinely want:  no social media copycats, privacy matters (do not track), and no for renaming a company but not changing culture (Meta). Leaders that ignore market trends undermine customer privacy, downplay employees' concerns, and treat themselves as superhumans do not work in today's age. Fighting and not giving up is right but fighting with human purpose is essential and wiser. I don't use Facebook products except for WhatsApp because that is the only way to speak with my mother and family back home. Plus, WhatsApp was not a Facebook invention. Anyway, I am all for more corporate institutions that create products for the marketplace and make money out of it but not in ways that undermine humanity and values.
