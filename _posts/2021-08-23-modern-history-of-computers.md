The Computer History Museum has an excellent one-page scroller on the modern history of computers. It begins with Bell Labs’ George Stibitz Model K (K stands for kitchen) circuit relay-based boolean adder in 1937, followed by mainframes, home computers, and mobile phones after that. It then ends in the 2010s with the Raspberry Pi, Apple Watch, and more.
