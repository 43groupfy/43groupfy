Inspiring quote from Mahatma Gandhi  
“ Whatever you do in life will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it because you can’t know. You can’t ever really know the meaning of your life. And you don’t need to. Every life has meaning, whether it lasts one hundred years or one hundred seconds.” Mahatma Gandhi.
