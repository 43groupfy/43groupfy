We are seeing a lot of contents from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and open sourced communities by researchers or academics in the field. That, and most of the contents are available at no cost, makes it an attractive way for students, academia, or even just regular people who want to increase their knowledge in the field to learn and polish their skills in the field. 

The contents and materials aren't even bad like one might think for free content. In fact, a lot of the courses from MOOCs platforms come from partnering with major universities such as Harvard (edX) and Johns Hopkins (Coursera). However, there are some downsides to joining these free classes, though. Most of the time, you can't access certain course materials, join assignments or quizzes, and receive certificates. Still, it's worth taking to help you get a good start in the field you're looking to improve. That way, you can explore and put your newfound skill into practice and build your own portfolio from the ground up, which equally attracts talent searchers.

By the way, some of the resources here include links to Youtube playlists from lecturers of representative universities. And since these times call for mostly online based learning, you can use this tool [Prodeus](https://www.prodeus.co/) to keep track of your learning progress and get your degree from Youtube (Yes, that's even their tagline).

Hope this helps! We'll cover some other productivity tools to help your learning journey in the next articles.

## Notable Sources

There is actually a lot of resources out there that you can use to learn Bioinformatics either for free or paid. One of the most notable one comes from two sources listed below.


### [OSSU for BioInformatics](https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics#curriculum)
![OSSU](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ab1e7ce255025d6c6b9431d43409217c21f70b6a/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6b5959435874432e706e67)
_The Open Source Society Curriculum for Bioinformatics_

This is a open sourced, community driven curriculum with online resource collections to learn Bioinformatics for free. Their description is :

> This is a solid path for those of you who want to complete a Bioinformatics course on your own time, for free, with courses from the best universities in the World.

The length of the course here is meant to be taken for in 4 years. But there is a case of a guy that went through learning an [entire 4 year MIT curriculum for Computer Science in 1 year](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), so I guess it depends on how motivated or ambitious you are as a person.

Here is an excerpt from the curriculum from OSSU for Bioinformatics.

#### Sample Curriculum for 2nd Year üîñ

Code | Course | Duration | Effort
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
BIO 2311 | [Biochemistry](https://www.edx.org/course/principles-biochemistry-harvardx-mcb63x) | 15 Weeks | 4-6 Hours/Week

üìñ I suggest you go ahead and head over to their GitHub page to learn more about the curriculum.

### [Rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)

Here's something a bit more interesting. For those familiar with programming tutorials and hands-on exercises on the web, you're probably familiar with learning projects such as [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Students or other users can test their ability to solve a series of challenging problems that test their practical understanding rather than theoretical knowledge. The [Rosalind Project](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is similar to Project Euler, but in this case, it is more focused on the Bioinformatics side.

Here you can test your programming knowledge and skills along with several other supporting materials for Bioinformatics, such as:
1. Tools used in Bioinformatics
2. Textbooks 
3. And Introductory lessons to algorithms such as graph theories and many more

## Other Sources

The two previously mentioned resources here are useful to get you a clear general view on Bioinformatics and acts as guidelines for you to start learning on your own both in terms of theoretical and practical knowledge. 

However, if, for some reason, those are not cut out for you, there are many more resources out there that you can use as well. I'll list it down below based on the category. Also, since this article focuses more on Bioinformatics resources, other resources for other topics will be written separately in the next article. Enjoy ‚òÄÔ∏è!

### Computation üíª
Before we get into the resources here, I would like to mention that when you want to work on biological data, it is easier for you to use the already established tools available. One of which is [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/), one of the providers for open source software for Bioinformatics for R. You can even find a [course for Bioconductor here](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-5-introduction-bioconductor-annotation-and-analysis-genomes-and?delta=0) from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

For those who are more into Python, there is also a library of tools for computational molecular biology from [Biopython](https://biopython.org/). There are many more libraries out there that you can use, but these are the common ones. If you find one that you think is useful, you can go ahead and contribute to the repo.

üéí Anyway, here's some list of courses you can follow for computational biology and some programming. Most of them are interactive based tutorials that you can follow. I'll do my best to categorize them based on their programming languages, starting from Python :
