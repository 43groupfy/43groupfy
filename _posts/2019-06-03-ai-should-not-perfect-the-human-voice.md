I think that machines must not perfect the human voice. That’s because racial and gender discrimination has hurt our generations for a very long time, so why make digital assistants such as Siri or Alexa speak in either a feminist, a masculine, a particular dialect, or in a specific voice? While we constantly interact with machines, would it make sense to discriminate by voice? It would be best for devices to maintain a pure gender/accent-neutral voice that does not sound male or female. Make it neutral. That way, we don’t add to the pain of discrimination that human races keep suffering all the time. One universal voice for AI speaks all (or most) human languages without preferring one tone or dialect over the other.
