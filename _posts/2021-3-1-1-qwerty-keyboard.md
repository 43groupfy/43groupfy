The (QWERTY) keyboard we all use daily dates back to 1874. Its inventor Christopher Latham Sholes aligned the keys to type faster. He avoided placing the most common pair of keys, such as "K" and "T," next to each other to prevent jamming when both keys placed on metal plates are rapidly pressed in succession. Note from the photo below that the numbers "1" and "0" are missing. That was to save costs since the letters "I" and "O" could be used instead.
