Loved the Netflix show <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304">The Queen’s Gambit</a>. It is about chess, but it is also about life, health, and competition. Pocket News has a nice collection of reading material to accompany the movie - <a  target="_blank" href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-queen-s-gambit-reading-list">A Chess Reading List for Watching ‘The Queen’s Gambit’</a>.
