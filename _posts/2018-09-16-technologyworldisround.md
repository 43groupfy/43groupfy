If the world is round, then so as the technology world is rounded as well. In the late seventies and eighties, the BASIC language and Assembly Language were hot things at the time. After that, people took on new technologies with the Internet and jumped on languages such as HTML, C, C++, Perl, Python, and JavaScript. Systems moved from 8bit to 64bit. Storage devices moved from cassette tape to the cloud. Typing a program onto the computer moved from copying lines of code from computer magazines onto the computer screen. Issuing the BASIC RUN command and witnessing the executing of the programs felt magic at the time. For those who didn’t live the 8bit era, the same feeling can be felt today when running a Docker script and witnessing your code and servers coming to life. 8bit programmers became the old school, while modern-day software engineers and data scientists became the new school. If you ask a Generation Z programmer what Assembly Language is or what is BASIC, they may not know. But somehow, the wonders of the seventies and eighties seem to be returning.  

The eighties are coming back, and I feel that I am that child nerd again. Commodore 64 returned as C64 Mini, and Sinclair Spectrum is now ZX Spectrum Next. I personally still play old 8bit games using emulators. You can also watch or listen to a lot of new retro computing episodes via podcasts or Netflix. Just yesterday, I started watching “warGames The movie” for the millionth time.  

BASIC and Assembly language are hot again. Assembly language made it to the top 15 languages according to TIOBE Index. Not long ago, I happened to meet a young person buying an assembly language book at Half Price book store. When I asked him why he bought the book, he answered, “I heard that is cool.” And today, I just saw that Google published WWWBasic, an implementation of BASIC that runs via JavaScript. You can do the following:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <script src="https://google.github.io/wwwbasic/wwwbasic.js"></script>
    <script type="text/basic">
    PRINT "Hello World!"
    FOR i = 1 to 10
    PRINT "Counting "; i
    NEXT i
    </script>

You can also import BASIC code as a Node.js module.

The world is round, and the technology world is round too.
