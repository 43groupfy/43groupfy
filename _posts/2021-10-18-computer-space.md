Paying tribute to the first commercial video, Computer Space, launched on October 15, 1971. In the game, you are controlling a ship and shooting against two flying saucers. The game idea was inspired by the first video game, Spacewar!, launched at MIT using Pdp1 mini-computer in 1961. (Hardly anything took place in the video game business between 1961 and 1971). Computer Space was not successful, but it motivated a team of geeks to create Atari and launch the extremely success game Pong in 1974.
