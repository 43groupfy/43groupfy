My home office setup is now officially complete after placing an extra 19â€™ tv next to the vinyl player and connecting my Atari and Commodore 64 minis to it. However, the challenge now is to convince my team that if I am not on Zoom camera-on, it does not mean that I am playing video games in my home office or listening to Pink Floyd or reading a Creative Computing book, or reflecting while staring out of the window. ðŸ˜Š#remotework #homeoffice #focus #designthinking #brainstorming #technology
