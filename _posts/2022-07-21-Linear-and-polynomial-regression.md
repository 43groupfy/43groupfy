## Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning. It is about learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output data. There are other types of machine learning such as unspervised learning which uses data with no labels and reinforcement learning which uses an agent that learn from its own action, but these will be covered later in the study.

## Linear Regression

Linear Regression or Linear Fitting is a perfect example of supervised learning.
