My late dad, who passed away in 2012, wrote a book about Cyprus in 1991. It was the first book about the Cypriot crises that was written in Arabic. At the time, we as a family were in so much debt due to the Lebanon conflict. As a kid then, having my dad publish the book and selling it gave me a feeling of family recovery from debt and buying my Commodore 64. Regardless of the outcome, publishing the book brought us joy and happiness and more love to our dad.#bookloversday
