이 논문은 이전 논문이 작성되고 2년 후에 작성되었는데, 기본 아이디어는 동일하지만 이전에 사용했던 DDPG 알고리즘이 수렴이 잘 되지 않는 문제가 있어 DDPG 대신에 SAC를 사용하였다.

## Background
---

* This paper is based on the previous study with very similar settings but difference
model.
* The DDPG algorithm(previously used) seems to have not much high convergence
during training
* Instead, use SAC(Soft Actor Critic) algorithm
  * Robustness, stability and well-convergence
  * State-of-the-art off-policy actor critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework

## Proposed method
---

* Single-Q SAC Algorithm : use SAC with some slight differences due to the method of combining imitation learning and reinforcement learning
  * The original SAC has two target parameters for Q-function
  * However, with previous experiment, the average return over 5 runs of 3 million iterations of SAC algorithm with double-A and SAC algorithm with single-Q are quite similar, so they only use one target parameter for each network and do not update the temperature parameter α for simplicity

## Results
---
* Although using pure SAC can result in a good performance, it still has a lower
average accumulated reward after 100 episodes than their method.
