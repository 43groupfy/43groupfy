Thimbleweed Park is an award-winning point-and-click game released in 2017 as a tribute to similar pc and Commodore 64 adventure games in the 80s. It was created by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, with design and development assistance from David Fox, Jenn Sandercock, and numerous other individuals. You control five characters simultaneously in a story that contains multiple sub-stories, interact with a multitude of characters in the game, and solve the puzzles you encounter. Each animated character has a very distinct personality that you can never forget even after completing the game and removing it from your phone or computer.

After spending more than 20 hours playing the game over some time, I was so impressed that I searched the net on its origin. I found a podcast by the game creators that ran weekly for two years, from April 2015 to April 2017, plus one more episode in April 2018. Most of the episodes are 20 minutes longs where the game creators discuss the game development progress. One episode each month is an hour-long and includes answering questions raised by Kickstarter-backer of the game and those posting comments on the game's website blogs.

My curiosity for listening to the podcast started with no apparent reason besides wanting to know more about the game, but it quickly became more significant. It wasn't about how to build a similar game or a nostalgia to bring back the 80s. It was about learning that such a talented team developed something innovative with a tremendous focus on detail while maintaining a set of rules and constraints that the developers intentionally bound themselves to keep the game with an 80's look and feel. The developers developed hit games for more than thirty years and included Zack Mackraken, Maniac Mansion, Indian Jones, and Loom. Back then, they were in their twenties. Now they are in their fifties and sixties with a lot of life experience combined with their lifelong passion for adventure games and science fiction.

From a technology perspective, the developers leveraged a lot of the traditional, modern-day technologies, such as Git for code repository, Adobe Photoshop for the art and animation in the game, software development kits (SDKs) for Steam, GOG, Xbox, Swift, Nintendo Swift, OSX, Android, Windows, Linux, and more. They were also blogging and podcasting their process, which was something unthinkable in the 80s. They were working remotely, using Skype for communication, and interacting with their supporters on social media channels. In the eighties, such technologies did not exist, of course. The limitations of 8-bit computing like the Commodore 64 did not stop all the creativity with music, graphics, and game playing. Nowadays, games run on 64-bit processors and are more technically sophisticated, such as leveraging augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence. The developers for Thimbleweed Park decided to do none of the cool new stuff.

Thimbleweed Park creators made sure all the graphics were limited to the 80s era. They also perfected all the details of the animated characters and the scenes using pixelated art. They added voice, special effects, and music that still made you feel that you were in the 80s. They also expanded the game to support international-speaking game players. They added innovative ideas to the whole project. For example, Kickstarter backers could record voicemails that can be played back whenever your character in the game dials a number from the phonebook. Other game backers can also send texts of some books, which the developers would add inside the library scene in the game. The game also includes many entertaining puzzles, like a microwave, a bathroom air blower appliance, or some berries in the forest. Some puzzles are challenging, but there is always an "Aha!" moment when you seek a hint within the game. I am not giving details about the game itself because I don't want to ruin the fun of playing it.

While the game itself was so innovative and entertaining, the conversations between the developers in the podcasts were also very casual and informative. It was equally fun as playing the game. The recording of the podcast episodes started when the game was getting developed. Like in any typical development process, things begin with early ideas and preparation work. The creators would not disclose many details about the game in their podcast because they did not want to ruin the story before its publication. Listening to the podcast episodes during the period of playing the game was double the fun. Unintentionally, you would relate the actual game scenes that are being discussed in the podcast episodes. Sometimes you would hope to find some clues about the game guilt-free because you want to avoid using the hints option in the game. The game creators talk in the podcast, and we listen. They call out specific feedback received from their Kickstarter backers and discuss it. Hence, you feel users' voices are included in the podcast. Sometimes they invite other members of the team working on the project. The episodes frequently include humor and nostalgia moments from the past. Even their personal lives would get shared on the call. As the episodes progress, they discuss their concerns about release timetables, bug fixes, issues with platform rollouts, and different problems which are not uncommon in any project. It is easy to wonder how the developers organize their work - the artistry, the development, the management, and everything else.

The podcast episodes feel authentic and nostalgic at the time. The experience of playing the game and listening to the creators' thoughts and interactions throughout the lifespan of the podcast that ran in tandem with the game development made me rethink how innovative thinking, natural human behavior, and organized execution can generate excellent results. If the project was rewarding to its creators and players, why not take more of such lessons and apply them to any project innovation.

Some of the insights that I learned from Thimbleweed Park, both the game and the podcast, are:

 * Nothing is impossible but don't be overly ambitious. Even though the developers and the artists were masters in their field, they did not go overboard with the project. They stayed faithful to what they wanted to do and did it exceptionally well.
  * They dedicated regular feedback channels for their customers. They allowed their users to suggest ideas but made the call whenever a draw occurred on which idea to pick. They also gave an option to their Kickstarter contributors at a specific level to be part of the game by letting them record their voicemail which you can listen to in the game if you dial the person's name and extension located in the game's telephone book. That is cool and original.
  * The podcasts were very entertaining and informative. They didn't shy away from discussing their past or sharing their concerns about the game development progress. A great lesson learned about honesty and humbleness.
  * The game itself had lots of challenging puzzles but also included an option to get a hint. Just like any product, you always need some guidance when you get stuck.
  * The story of the game is long but not long enough to give up. There was still something in the game that pulled you to continue playing. Even when you leave the game for days and return, you can quickly get back to the same rhythm before leaving the game. The user experience is excellent. Design a product with an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for you to return to where you last stopped and can help you recall what you should be doing next.

I can think of other ideas that one can learn from playing such a game. But at the end of the day, I can summarize it all as: design something as intuitive as playing some game, have fun doing it and let the users enjoy what they are doing with the product, be honest, do not over-commit but do not underachieve either. One last thing, play the game!
