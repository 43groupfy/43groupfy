Three months after moving to the tech capital of India, It was about time I re-indulge in my devops / tech passion.  I attended a SRE (site reliability engineering) Meetup organized at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) Bangalore office.

Since it was the first time I was going to EGL ([Embassy Golf Links](https://goo.gl/maps/M5XKBNPM4zdLocna8)), I started a little early and consequentially arrived there nearly 15-20 mins early. That gave me a chance to connect with the organizer and an early bird ([Pranav A](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranav-a-a029921b1/)) such as myself.  Pranav was a 2023 grad with two years of experience.  He is also an instructor on [whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/), having created a course on AWS.

The event started with an informal meet-and-greet, followed by a more formal self-introduction routine, where we gave a brief of who we are and why we were here. The majority of the congregation was made of techies in the early walks of their career, and also few experienced folks.  We then swiftly transitioned into the First talk of the session. 

The first talk of the day was rendered by [Bhagvatula Nipun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhagvatulanipun/)
