Sad month for IT publication magazines. After 30 years of publication, the Microsoft Development Network (MSDN) magazine, which first started as Microsoft Systems Journal in 1986 then consolidated with Microsoft Internet Developer magazine in 2000, has released its last paper issue this month. Its technology content will find its place through Microsoftâ€™s document websites, but the physical paper, the cover, and headlines were dear to my heart all those years. When the Internet did not exist, we, as kids, would rush to the store to get the latest computer magazines and enthusiastically read them cover to cover. I know that we are moving on through the digital world, but seeing more parts of our IT childhood going away through time and technology is sad.
