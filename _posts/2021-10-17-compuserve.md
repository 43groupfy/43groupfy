History bits: Before the Internet, there were three online service providers, Compuseve, AOL, and Prodigy. It was 1994. You would dial into the network, read news, chat with friends, and play video games. Compuserve was the oldest one of the providers. It started in 1969 as part of an insurance company to provide computer time sharing services and was later acquired by HR Block, the tax preparation company. The online service provider was then acquired by AOL in 1997 and then became part of Verizon in 2015.
