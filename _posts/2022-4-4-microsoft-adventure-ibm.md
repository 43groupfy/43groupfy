Finally managed to get the first pc game ever bundled with each new IBM PC in 1981, Microsoft Adventure. (The other game was part of the operating system DOS 1.0 and was called Donkey, written by Bill Gates). I had the cover and case for a couple of years (rare to find) and kept hunting for the original 5.25â€™ floppy of Microsoft Adventure to complete the package. The one that I found is copy-protected too. I do have a working copy of the game that runs on an emulator, but having such a hard copy of the game reminds me of all the text adventure games that I was obsessed with during childhood and to this day.
