I once gave up pushing my kids into computer science, but my teenage son Adam insisted on sticking with digital art design. I was skeptical at first, maybe because I am too wired to computers as a science rather than an art. But when I heard from my colleagues about my son’s creative work, which ultimately awarded him his first paying job as part of the Youth Advisory Board at Banfield, I realized how I got the idea of technology passion all mixed. I know that our kids see the world differently from our parents, which is particularly true between me, as a techie science dad, and my artistic son. Watching my son and my daughter finding their career path at an early stage and hearing others commending their first work are the very proudest moments for me and my wife Mayssaloun. When Adam got an email confirming his selection to the advisory board, his first words to us, his parents, were “guess what company has 2 Hoteits working for them:).”
