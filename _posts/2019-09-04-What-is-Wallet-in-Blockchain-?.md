Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet, making using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online.

Going in-depth, we could signify the definition for the crypto wallets like, `"Crypto wallets store your private keys, keeping your crypto safe and accessible. They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum."`

`Understanding how crypto wallets work`
Blockchain is a public ledger that stores data in known as "blocks." These are records of all transactions, the balances held at any given address, and who holds the key to those balances. Crypto is not stored "in" a wallet, per se. The coins exist on a blockchain, and the wallet software allows you to interact with the balances held on that blockchain. The wallet itself stores addresses and allows its owners to move coins elsewhere while also letting others see the balance held at any given address.

*"Most Crypto wallets allow users to send, receive, and store crypto. Some have a feature to buy and spend cryptocurrencies,"* says Utsav Dar, co-founder of Incub8 Finance. *"Certain crypto wallets have additional features like swapping between tokens, staking tokens for a fixed return paid out to users, and access to DApps (decentralized applications) built on various networks."*

While each wallet has its specific nuances, here are the general steps involved in sending or receiving funds using a crypto wallet:

 - `To receive funds,` you need to retrieve an address (also known as a public key) from your wallet. Locate the "generate address" feature in your wallet, click it, copy the alphanumeric address or QR code and share it with the person who wants to send you crypto.

 - `To send funds,` you need the address of the receiving wallet. Locate the "send" feature in your wallet and enter the wallet's address you intend to send coins to. Select the amount of crypto you would like to send, and click "confirm." Consider sending a small test transaction before sending large amounts of crypto. Note that sending coins requires a fee paid to miners in exchange for processing the transaction.

Sending money via QR codes or long strings of numbers and letters may seem strange. However, after doing it a few times, it becomes pretty simple.


`How do you use a crypto wallet?`
Crypto wallets range from simple-to-use apps to more complex security solutions. The main types of wallets you can choose from include:

`Paper wallets:` Keys are written on a physical medium like paper and stored in a safe place. This, of course, makes using your crypto harder because digital money can only be used on the internet. 

`Hardware wallets:` Keys are stored in a thumb-drive device that is kept in a safe place and only connected to a computer when you want to use your crypto. The idea is to try to balance security and convenience.

`Online wallets:` Keys are stored in an app or other software – look for one that is protected by two-step encryption. This makes sending, receiving, and using your crypto easier than using an online bank account, payment system, or brokerage. 

Each type has its tradeoffs. Paper and hardware wallets are more complicated for malicious users to access because they are stored offline, but they are limited in function and risk being lost or destroyed. Online wallets offered by a major exchange like Coinbase are the simplest way to get started in crypto and offer a balance of security and easy access. (Because your private info is online, your protection against hackers is only as good as your wallet provider's security – so make sure you look for features like two-factor verification.)
