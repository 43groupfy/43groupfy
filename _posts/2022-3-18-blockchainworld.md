I have been spending some nighttime playing with the [NEAR blockchain network](https://near.org/). I downloaded the libraries, wrote small WebAsssembly scripts for simple Hello World style of Web3 dApps, and then saw the transactions/smart contracts unfolding on the NEAR.testnet blockchain network. It is all cool. It takes time to get used to it, especially from the Web1 and Web2 Internet coding worlds. It is like the first steps we took when the Internet started - learning HTML and JavaScript. It is now WebAssembly (AssemblyScript or Rust) and JavaScript for Smart Contracts. When I got bored, I jumped to [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) Metaverse. I walked around the virtual world while carrying Ethereum Blockchain Mana tokens accessible via MetaMask connected to my hardware Ledger crypto wallet for maximum security. It is a fascinating new experience - hopping from one blockchain to another and imagining how all those networks or variations will become the new digital world.
