Well, to be honest, I don't really have a firm stance on things. It may seem like I do, but the truth is, I'm a bit indecisive. Every thought that pops into my head feels like a brilliant gem of wisdom, at least in my own mind. So, there you have it! :sparkles: :rofl:

So, the purpose of this blog is to share my thoughts and opinions on things that I find interesting. I will try to keep it as professional as possible, but I can't promise that I won't go off on a tangent every now and then. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them. :smile:

## Somethings about me

1. I have a tendency to argue with people with different opinion than mine. Sometimes I argue with facts, and othertimes, with belief extrapolated by the induction of logic and also at times with pure emotion. Whatever the approach is, I argue and that seems to be my habit. 

Cheers !!! :wine_glass:
