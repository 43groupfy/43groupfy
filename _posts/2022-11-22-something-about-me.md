I am an introvert person who is exhausted by outward activities regularly. I like to spend most of my time alone or with some of my friends. I like keeping my life secret. I seem to be sensitive to things that I value and critiquing myself. The only time I have some confidence is when I think my idea/thoughs are genuine and mine.

Well, to be honest, I don't really have a firm stance on things. It may seem like I do, but the truth is, I'm a bit indecisive. Every thought that pops into my head feels like a brilliant gem of wisdom, at least in my own mind. So, there you have it! ü§£

I consider myself a student of studying myself by observation. So, the purpose of this blog is to share my thoughts and opinions on things that I find interesting. I will try to keep it as professional as possible, but I can't promise that I won't go off on a tangent every now and then. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them. :smile:

Cheers !!! üç∫
