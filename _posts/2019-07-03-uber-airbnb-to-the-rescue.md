If past governments could not turn Lebanon into a non-sectarian non-religious-divided society, mobile services apps like Uber and Airbnb might do that. Lebanon is divided between Moslem and Christian areas. Peaceful during most times, but you would feel awkward if you are a person of one religion hanging out or living on the opposite side. You are easily called out by uttering your name or mentioning where you are from. The problem does not usually escalate, but it is an uneasy situation, and it has been like this for decades. But, nowadays, apps like Uber and Airbnb have made it possible for people of any religion to move around or lodge in all areas without problems. Such apps do not discriminate, and no app consumer or service provider wants terrible publicity online. With such apps, people can live happily with their neighbors regardless of sect or religion, and service-based mobile apps can help boost individualsâ€™ income. When I was recently in Lebanon, I enjoyed Airbnb and Uber wherever we were and felt that we were in a new age of unity and prosperity.
