# 矛 Spear Phishing

## overview

- a unique form of phishing
- **targets a specific organization**

- an e-mail spoofing fraud attempt that targets a specific organization, seeking unauthorized access to confidential data.

- the message is made like from someone you know and trust, not informal third party.
  - spear phishing messages appear to come from a trusted source. an individual within the recipient's own company, someone in a position of authority.
  - Phishing messages usually appear to come from a large and well-known company or Web site with a broad membership base, like eBay or PayPal.

- Example:
  - a message that appears to be `from your boss` telling you that there is a problem with your direct deposit account and that you need to access this HR link right now to correct it.
- works better than phishing: uses information from email databases, friends lists…

## solution
- One solution:
  - **use digital signatures**.
- The CEO and anyone else in the company can sign their emails with a digital signature.
- This provides a high level of certainty to personnel on who sent the email.
