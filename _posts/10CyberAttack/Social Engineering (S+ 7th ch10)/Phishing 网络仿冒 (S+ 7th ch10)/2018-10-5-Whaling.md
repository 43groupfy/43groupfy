# Whaling
	nothing more than phishing or spear phishing, but for big users. target high-level executives.
	the whaler identifies one person who can gain all of the data they want, a manager or owner, and targets the phishing campaign at them.

	Example:
	attackers singled out as many as 20,000 senior corporate executives in a fine-tuned phishing attack.
	The emails looked like official subpoenas requiring the recipient to appear before a federal grand jury, included the executive’s full name and other details,
	The emails also included a link for more details about the subpoena.
	If clicked the link, it took them to a web site that indicated they needed a browser add-on to read the document.
	If they approved this install, they actually installed a keylogger and malware.
	⁃	Keylogger: recorded all keystrokes to a file,
	⁃	Malware: gave the attackers remote access to the executives’ systems.

Although not as common, some whaling attacks attempt to reach the executive via phone to get the data. However, many executives have assistants who screen calls to prevent attackers from reaching the executive via phone.
