What can be a great item to frame in my vintage computing office library? A 70-year copy of the first Time magazine cover that features a computer and references AI? The cover is 1950 Howard Aiken’s Mark III computer, and the corresponding article of January 23, 1950, edition discusses early artificial intelligence with the title “can man build a superman?”
