A big wish for me came true this weekend when I had the honor to present in Palo Alto Silicon Valley to my fellow alumni at the American University of Beirut. I talked about my passion for computers from childhood to high school to college, and after. I rediscovered myself during my college years after working in between and appreciating the value of education by learning from my mistakes. Then after that becoming a webmaster and getting deep into Internet web development right when the Internet kicked off in the mid-90s. I stopped my talk in 2001 when my wife and I moved to the United States, where I later took leading technology jobs and delivered software products with my team. Summarizing the first 20 years of sweat and love for the technology machine into 15 minutes was tough but worth it for me. I loved every minute of it. Hopefully, I will have a chance to tell me my next 20 years and ongoing tech story in the US.
