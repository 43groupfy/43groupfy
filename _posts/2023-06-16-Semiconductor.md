A semiconductor is a substance that possesses both the characteristics of a conductor, allowing electricity to flow, and an insulator, which restricts the flow of electricity. Among the devices that utilize semiconductors, those involved in controlling and converting electrical power, such as power supplies, are referred to as power semiconductors.

A power semiconductor is a type of semiconductor device specifically designed to handle high power and high voltage levels. It is used in various applications where efficient control and conversion of electrical power are required. Power semiconductors play a crucial role in power electronics, which is the technology of converting and controlling electrical power.

Some common types of power semiconductors and their operation:
1. Diode: A diode is two-terminal devices that allow current to flow in one direction and block it in the reverse direction. They are widely used in rectification circuits to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC).
2. Transistor: A transistor is three-terminal devices that can amplify or switch electrical signals and handle high power levels. They are used in applications such as motor control, power supplies, and audio amplifiers.
3. Power MOSFET: A power MOSFET is a specific type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor(MOSFET) designed to handle significant power levels, it's a type of power transistor that are known for their low on-resistance and fast switching speed. They are widely used in applications such as power supplies, DC-DC converters, and audio amplifiers.
4. IGBT: An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a type of power transistor that combines the high-speed switching capability of a transistor with the low on-resistance of a power MOSFET. They are commonly used in applications requiring high voltage and high current switching, such as in motor drives and power converters.
5. Thyristor: A thyristor are four-layer, three-terminal semiconductor devices that can control large amounts of electrical power. They are commonly used in applications where the power needs to be controlled, such as in AC voltage regulators and motor speed control.
