This Monday there was an advanced ha. It was really difficult. It took me all day to complete the task. For some reason, there was a big mistake in the signUp.js and took me forever to solve that problem.  
The shocking part was the very next day, I got a message from codestates and they told me that there was a problem with my code and I needed a check-in. Luckily there was nothing wrong with my code and I passed. Two days ago we formed a group of 4 to start doing our project. I will be doing the backend part.  
It feels like I don’t know much yet but I’ll try my best to get better and to help my teammates.  
I thank everyone who helped me to get through all this.
