Today I finished the im-sprint-cmarket-redux. It was difficult but quite interesting at the same tiem cause I could actually see the web working just like amazon(not all but some features like adding items to cart and deleting them).  

I learned about Object.assign() today.
The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties of given objects to a single object and returns it.  

The syntax of the `assign()` method is:  

`Object.assign(target, ...sources)`    

The `assign()` method, being a static method, is called using the `Object` class name.  

##assign()Parameters  
The `assign()` method takes in:  
  - `target`- It is the target object from which values and properties have to be copied.    
  - `sources`- The source object(s) - objects containing the properties you want to apply. It is the source object to which values and properties have to be copied.    

##Return value from assign()  
  - Returns the target object.  
  (Note: Properties in the target object are overwritten by properties in the sources if they have the same key.)
