## Britcoin – Input, Computation, Output
<hr style="border-top: 1px solid;"><br>

```
gizmore, sabretooth and dloser lost all their money 
they had invested into cryptocurrencies.

In a rush, dloser asks gizmore to create their own cryptocoin.

But before we even start we wonder about the underlying cryptographic 
prove of work algorithm.

Your job is to hash a hash with a nonce 
to produce a valid prove of work, according to the specs[Link].

Before i forget; This is your session´s initial Block data:
{
  "initial_trust":null,
  "transactions":[
      {"from":null,"to":"index","amt":1,"note":"Mining success"}, 
      {"from":null,"to":"livinskull","amt":1},
      {"from":null,"to":"sabretooth","amt":1},
      {"from":"livinskull","to":"sabretooth","amt":0.000000001,"note":"Fraction check"}]
}

And this is the computed nonce zero for comparison:
95D9027455F90125644ADCE39FA6BC567F663FFD05C17D907F6CF77E39D3D5F08CD152DE1157F5A4F4015050F003F469EC9CDA81936FBF4A2CFB548EF275FEDF

Your pow hash has to start with 00000000.
Your nonce is your answer, uppercase 32 hex digits.

Good luck!
