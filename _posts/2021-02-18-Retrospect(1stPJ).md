**First Project Retrospect**

The first project ended a couple of days ago.  
I think things turned out pretty well. All thanks to my awesome teammates. It was a very special two weeks and I believe we all learned a lot. I was really glad and happy to do this project with the people that I like. Now we are starting our next project which is going to be continued for 4 weeks. I hope I'll do a better job this time.

My team is planning to use the first week to study more so that we might have less trouble during our project. I think that's a great idea. And I think our idea for the project is pretty interesting. I hope we will do well again.

I decided to take some on-line course that will help me understand and do better. Hopefully I'll improve a lot.
