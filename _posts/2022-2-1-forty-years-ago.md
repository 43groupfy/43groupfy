Forty years ago, we kids would show our parents how to use the video player (VHS / Betamax). Thirty years ago, we’d show how to use the CD player. Twenty years ago, we’d show them how to use the computer. Ten years ago, we would show them how to use social media. Now, our kids are showing us parents metaverse, 8k gaming, spatial sound, crypto investing, NFTs, and web3. We are now kids again. We were the kids who would teach their parents tech, but now we are the kids who are taught about tech by kids.
