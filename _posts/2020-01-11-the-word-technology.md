1610s, "a discourse or treatise on an art or the arts," from Greek _tekhnologia_ "systematic treatment of an art, craft, or technique," originally referring to grammar, from _tekhno-,_ combining form of _tekhnē_ "art, skill, craft in work; method, system, an art, a system or method of making or doing," from PIE _*teks-na-_ "craft" (of weaving or fabricating), from suffixed form of root [*teks-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*teks-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to weave," also "to fabricate." For ending, see [-logy](https://www.etymonline.com/word/-logy?ref=etymonline_crossreference).
