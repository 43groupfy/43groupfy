I didn't have a chance to write this until now, but I want to pay tribute to the late computer engineer Chuck Peddle who passed away on Dec 15 at the age of 82. Chuck is the inventor of the $25 6502 microprocessor in the 70s (equivalent to $130 today) that created the personal computer industry and powered all significant mass personal computers in the late 70s and 80s (Apple II, Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and more). Even though Motorola and Intel processors later dominated the technology industry by powering all IBM PC compatible & Mac computers, Chuck's $25 microprocessor made personal computers affordable and accessible to programmers, hackers, and consumers of the personal computer era.  
RIP, Chuck.
