A best of both worlds:

- VIM mode for rapid coding, inserting and moving around the text ever since the terminal days using key command shortcuts

- The Jupyter Labs for interactive Python coding.

Also, the plugin "jupyterlab-vim" (<a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/axelfahy/jupyterlab-vim">github - axelfahy/jupyterlab-vim</a>) is a Jupyter extension that creates VIM bindings for your notebooks. The tool brings the power of VIM into your data science projects. It is accessible on <a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/axelfahy/jupyterlab-vim">Github</a>.
