The corporate world should seriously embrace Generation Z into their workforce. Those born after 1997 are entering the workforce this year. Their approach in IT is to build applications with immediate real-world implications. <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/developers-take-gen-z-developers-are-looking-to-make-an-impact-but-not-necessarily-in-silicon-valley/" >Check what two GenZ engineers Nisha and Clarisse have to say at a HackerRank interview</a>. Also, the financial bank BBVA Compass and Skratch, a platform for teenagers, partnered together in Dallas to build an application for teenagers to make money from community activities such as scooping ice cream at school fairs or teaching kids how to mix music like DJs. (<a target="_blank" href="https://dallasinnovates.com/bbva-compass-skratch-collab-to-welcome-gen-z-to-gig-economy" >Read more about it</a>.)

Generation Z is on track to be the best-educated and most diverse generation yet. (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/11/15/early-benchmarks-show-post-millennials-on-track-to-be-most-diverse-best-educated-generation-yet/" >Check Pew Research article</a>). 48% of them are racial or ethnic minorities and have similar liberal-leaning political and social views as Millennials (born between 1980–1995). (See Pew Research <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" >article</a>.) However, similar to Nisha and Clarisse, Generation Z has its take on society and the workplace. SalesForce updated their blog post on" <a target="_blank" href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/10/how-millennials-and-gen-z-are-different.html" >Millennials vs. Gen Z: How Are They Different?</a> ". I quote from the article:

  1. More millennials than GenZers will pay extra for customer experience
  2. Gen Z sets a higher bar for expecting innovation from companies
  3. Gen Z is less likely than the millennial generation to trust companies — but can be swayed
  4. Gen Z is pragmatic; millennials are idealistic
  5. Gen Z focuses on saving money; millennials are more focused on the experience
  6. Millennials liked authenticity, but Gen Z takes it to a new level
  7. Gen Z prefers in-store shopping; millennials shop online
  8. Millennials cozy up to brands; Gen Z wants to be independently themselves

I recommend checking the SalesForce article since each of the bullets above is described in detail.

For companies to be more successful in the digital world, their products and services mustn 't be assuming all generations of customers (and employees) as one or as merely dividing in half between old vs. new. Having a clear understanding of the differences between millennials and post-millennials who are about to form the largest workforce can make a huge difference in companies ' bottom line and positive social change across the world. The latter is what all generations should be caring about, except that Gen Z is actively managing more about it than everyone else.
