The 2007 AlphaSmart Neo 2 is my ultimate distraction-free word processor because it simply does not connect to the Internet. It is a full-size keyboard with a small screen that is not even in color or a backlight. It is perfect for focused writing! You type straight into its memory/internal storage. You don’t even need to install any software on your pc. After you plug in a USB cable into your computer and open any text editor you use, you click send, and the text is transferred one character at a time. It mimics the way keyboards work. The manufacturer built this for schools but discontinued it after chrome books and IPads became popular in schools. It found a recent revival by writers who needed a writing platform that discourages them from doing anything else but writing. You will discover the remaining ones on eBay. On a similar note, I am also using a 30-year-old Casio databank to store anything that I don’t want residing in a cloud. The beauty of these non-Internet connected devices is that they are very reliable. You also don’t have to worry about data leaking on the web. The primary batteries last for months, and the backup batteries last for years. Some old tech is genuinely reliable to this day.
