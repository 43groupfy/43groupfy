RIP [Sir Clive Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Sinclair), an Engish genius who helped shape home computing in the late seventies and early eighties. He invented the first mass computer for under 100 pounds, the ZX 80, and produced technologies far ahead of his time, such as a 1975 computer watch and a 1985 e-vehicle. He single-handedly launched the British video game industry that drew competition from BBC Micros, Atari, and Commodore computers. Moreover, his contributions encouraged the development of the BBC Micro by his rival, which led the BBC Micro engineers to develop the ARM processor that eventually became the chip in all mobile and IoT devices in the world and led to the invention of the Raspberry Pi. Whether it is Sinclair 's inventions or competition, Sir Clive Sinclair was a founding father in home computing. A 2011 movie that is based on true events called "Micro Men" tells the story of Sir Clive Sinclair and the early days of British computing. You can check it below.
