MVC stands for model view controller.  
It is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.

##Model

Models are the essence of Sequelize. A model is an abstraction that represents a table in your database.  
The model tells Sequelize several things about the entity it represents, such as the name of the table in the database and which columns it has (and their data types).  
A model in Sequelize has a name. This name does not have to be the same name of the table it represents in the database. Usually, models have singular names (such as User) while tables have pluralized names (such as Users), although this is fully configurable.  
A model is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

##View

Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

##Controller  
Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.  
In addition to dividing the application into these components, the model–view–controller design defines the interactions between them.

- The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It receives user input from the controller.
- The view means presentation of the model in a particular format.
- The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives the input, optionally validates it and then passes the input to the model.
