Lately, I 've been reading an old vintage book on computers: Frank Herbert (creator of Dune) book "Without Me You 're Nothing: The Essential Guide to Home Computers" published in 1981 (ISBN 0671412876, ~$10 on Amazon). Coauthored with Max Bernard, he talks about how computers work at the time and in the future. Forty years after, I could not find any single prediction that did not happen. What a visionary! The book is genuinely entertaining. I highly recommend it for techies.
