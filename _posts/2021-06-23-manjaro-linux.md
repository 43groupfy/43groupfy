Super impressed with Manjaro Linux that is based on Arch Linux. In the past, I would spend time configuring Arch Linux to my liking but, now, I want something stable, quick, and saves me time but with the power of Arch Linux. Manjaro Linux, a French origin distribution, does just that! I took the jump from Debian / Ubuntu after being faithful to the latter for over ten years.
