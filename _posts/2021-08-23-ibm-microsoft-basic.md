In the eighties, weâ€™d code on an IBM PC using Microsoft DOS 2.10 and BASIC. Does anyone remember GWBASIC and BASICA? Everything was terminal-based until MS Windows, and the Apple Macintosh came along. Forty years later, coding, scripting, writing, and managing cloud containers remains cool using the terminal. I got the eighties vintage computing items below to remind me of where we started. Thank you, Microsoft and IBM, for those DOS days!
