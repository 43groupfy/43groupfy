- Generative AI (answers for everything)

**Program**
- python
- panda

**AI modeling**
- pyTorch
- Tensor flow

**ML platforms**

## Traditional AIML vs GenAI

Traditional AIML
- good at **identify pattern**
- learning from the pattern
- limit success with close supervised learning of very large amount of data
- must have human involved


GenAI
- produces 'content' (text, image, music, art, forecasts, etc...)
- use 'transformers' (Encoders/Decoders) based on pre-trained data using small amount of fine tuning data
  - encode and decode at the same time
    - less data and faster
    - GenAI use small data and uses encoders and decoders and Transformers to take that smaller data and be able to use it for other types of models. (Pre training)
    - then add on top of it small amounts of fine tuning data
    - and then get a a training model.
  - As perceptions, not neurons.

## Attention is all you need

- high alignment
