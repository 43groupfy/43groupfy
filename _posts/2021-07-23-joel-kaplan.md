Joel Kaplan is the co-founder of 1010data. In the 2016 view below, Joel shares valuable insights on computer languages. His talk begins with the legendary predecessors Archimedes, Leibniz, and Godel. Then he talks about Iverson's APL (A Programming Language), which is the predecessor of all array-based programming languages, including the language K. Joel also talks about his journey in the tech industry in the late sixties and seventies, especially at IBM coding in APL on the IBM 5100. It is a truly informative video. I recommend all techies out there to watch it. I am so impressed by the technology culture at 1010data. The company continues to push the boundaries of data science to extreme levels that add so much value to the industry and our customers.
