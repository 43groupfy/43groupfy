This sprint was really tough. It wasn't easy to understand how the whole thing was working.  
However, thanks to my pair sleepybird, we finished it yesterday and had a chance to try it again today.  
From this sprint I could really check what was my biggest weakness. Stuffs like async and callbacks.  
Even though it was very difficult, I think I had a real good time. Really felt like I am learning something.

I should probably revise again.  
This week is going to be very busy. And I hope I prepare well for next week's ha.
