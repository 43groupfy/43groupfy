Blockchain is public for all but the information saved in the Blockchain is not public for all the users as it comes up with SHA encryption, and the information is only accessed during verification of the data by the legitimacy miners only.

Thinking about anonymity in terms of Blockchain and cryptocurrency, we could look for some points listed below.

The only thing to take in the consideration is,
> `BLOCKCHAIN AREN"T ANONYMOUS BUT THEY ARE PSEDUONYMOUS! `

Similar to how authors will sometimes write under a pseudonym, you send and receive cryptocurrency using a pseudonym. Instead of a fictitious name, your blockchain pseudonym is your public address. This long string of numbers and letters does not contain any identifiable information that would tie you to the address or its associated wallet.

Consider a public hash of 32 bit like 567sdf89h..v56eg4 this, which is available publically in the blockchain domain, but no one could undermine what this means!


Because the complicated addresses mask your identity, many people think that activity on a blockchain is anonymous. While public addresses protect your privacy to some extent, other blockchain features tend to expose you.
