In the eighties, we used to have home computers, such as the Commodore or the BBC Micro, with a keyboard. All we had to do was plug it into the tv, and WHAAAMMM… we are in our computer world. The Raspberry Pi is reviving the same experience with their new Raspberry Pi 400 computer. The keyboard itself has a built-in computer. It is fantastic and cheap, especially for home and education use.
