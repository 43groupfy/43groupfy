I found two 80s Atari vinyl which include music and story telling. The covers are exactly as the games. How odd is that. The ones that I found were Missile Command and Yars Revenge. I also found Asteroids on eBay and bought it. Someone wrote about the Asteroids vinyl at this [Mostly Retro](http://mostly-retro.com/2013/05/01/ataris-asteroids-now-on-vinyl/). The [Atari Age forum](https://atariage.com/forums/topic/194564-all-atari-kids-stuff-records-now-available-for-download/) mentions a total of 7 made in the 80s, with only three as Atari games.
