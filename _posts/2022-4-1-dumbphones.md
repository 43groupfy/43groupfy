The return of "dumbphones" is also a return of dumb devices that helps one remain focused and less overwhelmed 24/7 with technology. From the BBC News article ["Not smart but clever? The return of 'dumbphones"](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60763168) , "one report said that global purchases of dumbphones were due to hit one billion units last year, up from 400 million in 2019. This compares to worldwide sales of 1.4 billion smart phones last year, following a 12.5% decline in 2020."
