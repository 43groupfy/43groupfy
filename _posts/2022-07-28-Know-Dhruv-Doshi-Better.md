Hi everyone, this is **Dhruv Doshi**. Let's look at my life journey!

Born in Ahmedabad, India, in 1999; yes, that makes me pre 2000's for a fact. I was fascinated with computer science and how everything changed my childhood, and it was my ambition to make worthy products within computer science and transform the world.

I started my primary computer education at the age of 13 and developed my first game at the age of 14. This was a basic game written in C language with my computer class teacher. My parents saw my dedication and interest in computer direction and suggested taking computer science for my high school. This gave me a taste of computer science and scripting language reasonably early. 

I was sure this was my motivation, and I could write the code for the rest of my life. This pushed me to start *Bachelor's in Engineering with a major in Computer Engineering*. This was one of the best decisions of my life, and here comes the story!

I was the notorious one who did not attend the lecture but made sure to get in the top 5 of the class. I was fond of technical events and hackathons, which resulted in attending more than *20 events within the span of 2 months*. This was when I heard about Blockchain; This was just a click in my head. **Hearing decentralized and transparent was atypical in those days, but "no single point of failure" was the line that ensured this is the future of computer science. I thought I got what the internet was in the 90s.**

I returned to university and discussed this with a bunch of professors, trying to learn more and more about blockchain, but no one had prior knowledge about blockchain. I started scraping through the internet and found many articles and books. Please read all of them and start working on the project, <a href="https://github.com/DhruvDoshi/DCS-BBN">**`DCS-BBN`**</a>.

I found a burning issue of having residue storage of hardrive underutilized. I already paid for the stuff, and I'm not earning any productivity from this running 24*7. I thought that there would be multiple users who were experiencing this situation. I came up with the approach to store the archival data on the residue storage with Blockchain encoding. This ensured the code's security and the adoption of a new crypto token, DCSCoin, which could be used for the transaction.

I worked on this project for over *two years* and ensured the funding from VCs. Later, this project was depreciated as I planned to move for a master's in Computer science. 

Meanwhile, I worked as a **Freelance Blockchain developer**. I started with a project in the Netherlands for the government. I'm bound with NDA's for talking much of business logic, but here is some stuff I could share!

**`CRYPTOVANTAGE`**: A monitoring system for blockchain transactions, "Illicit."

*Monitoring System:* Develop an Illicit transaction detection system on cryptocurrencies single-handedly. Used JavaScript, Python and GO language. Tested the product for vulnerability and potential threats. I leveraged a considerable amount of transnational data for the optimum solution
*Technologies:* Python, Go, Solidity, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS, GitHub, Remix, AWS, Unix

After this, I started my master's with Dalhousie University, Canada, and alongside that, I got **`Research Assistantship`**, working on Worked on Algorithm and code for tracing table generation of given code. The project's objective is to help new students in computer science to visualize the flow of the code. Developed using Python and HTML  

Continuing that, I Worked as **Teaching Assistant** for four subjects, *Advance topics in Cloud Computing, Introduction to Data Science, Software Development, and Introduction to Computer Science.* Taking Labs, solving questions and explaining code were the think for me. This also made me learn better time and man management. Alongside this, *my freelance blockchain work was still going on*.

Further on, I started working as **`Blockchain Architect`** with the company based in Halifax, **`HealthCard`**. Developing a verification engine for document verification automation with Blockchain protocols. **Transforming** the traditional reward function with the crypto reward function to have more leverage and accessibility for the platform moving ahead and developing the protocol that other organizations could utilize.

 - **Verification Engine:** Developing documents verification system with Hyperledger Fabric and Solidity contracts. All the manual document verification would be handled by a blockchain engine working on AI Algorithms
 - **Reward Functions:** Reconstructing reward function to cater to Ethereum tokens over the main network. Developed a specific equation that would accordingly dictate the amount of tokens allocated to every user
 - **Containerized Application:** Shifting the monolithic architecture to Kubernetes containerized application, transforming it to micros-service architecture.

*Developed using* Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Solidity, Python, React.JS<br />
*Tools* used Bitbucket, Jira, Remix, GCP, Kubernetes<br />
<ins>I'm still associated with this project.</ins>

As the master's was course based, I needed to work as a full-time CO-OP student. With associated with Finance, Payment, Blockchain, AI, and Cloud, what better place than **`Canada Revenue Agency`** to learn more about litigation and finance in development. I started as a CO-OP student working as **`Full Stack Developer`** on,
 - Secure Portal Re-engineering: Migrating CRA website from Struts version to Angular version for upgrading. Worked with multiple backend APIs and data flows. 
 - Accessibility Issues: Solving accessibility bugs for specially-abled users. Worked on the Quartz library, which is used for the development of every component within the application

With experience in Blockchain Development over four years, AI over three years, and making graduate students learn cloud taught me a lot! and working as a full stack developer, these are my tech stack!

**`Languages`**: Python, Java, JavaScript, GO, Solidity
**`Blockchain`**: Hyperledger Fabric, ERC-20, Remix, MetaMask, Ganache, Truffle.js 
**`Artificial Intelligence`**: TensorFlow, TFLearn, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit Learn
**`Cloud Technologies`**: AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku, CI/CD Pipelines
**`Frameworks`**: React.js, Vue.js, Django, Flask, Spring
**`Tools & DB`**: GIT, JIRA, Postman, MongoDB, MySQL, DynamoDB
