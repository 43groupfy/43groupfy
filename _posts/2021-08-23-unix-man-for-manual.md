All operating systems and personal computer software were born after creating the Unix operating system in 1969. But for the first two years of Unix, no documentation existed until the manager of Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson insisted that they create a digital guide for the operating system. This led to the “man” command (short for manual), which is still a key part of Unix/Linux. Easily accessible documentation within the system helped make Unix, C, and other modules help all developers and users. How often one finds oneself struggling between typing on a keyboard in one hand and having an actual tech book in the other? Online manuals are easier, whether it is the F1 key, or /? or “man” (manual). Even more, imagine if no documentation existed. Would the tech world be the same? Issue of lack of documentation is always a problem in tech. Developers hate to document, and managers miss out on this all the time. Everyone forgets this until it is too late. Calling out to all developers to always document your code to leave positive traces behind for others.
