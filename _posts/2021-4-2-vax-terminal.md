While reading Tracy Kidder book “The Soul of a New Machine” which tells the entrepreneurship history of minicomputers, I remembered the VAX terminal machines we used at the American University of Beirut Computer Science department a long time ago. We were coding on green screens and getting mesmerized with code printouts from the matrix paper. We would lay the printouts on the floor and analyze the code. I don’t recall if the terminal workstation was a DEC VT220 like the wiki photo below, but it surely was an exciting period of thinking in code while bounded by the constraints of technology at the time.
