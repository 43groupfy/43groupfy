Our communication with computers started with punch cards in 1800. Thanks to the loom 's invention, the Hollerith Card and, later, the IBM Cards. Programmers and scientists would code, debug, and generate output using such cards. I managed to get a collection of such cards. A sample is shown below, along with the cards ' origin and labels. The cards vary from ale University Computer Center, Northwestern University, IBM, Sears, COBOL, Department of Defense, Columbus Laboratories, University of Minnesota, IBM 360, IBM 1620, and more.
