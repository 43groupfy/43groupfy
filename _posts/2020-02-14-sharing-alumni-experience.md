This Saturday, I will be geeking out on AI, machine learning, computing, cloud computing, and entrepreneurship with fellow professors, doctors, and alumni in Silicon Valley / Paolo Alto.

Many of my fellow computer science and engineering graduates from the American University of Beirut currently living in the US and attending the reunion have leading positions in organizations that include Google, Amazon, Coupa, Ontologik.ai, Stanford, Salesforce, and more â€œ Banfield as well for me, of course.

I will also have a chance to share on stage my career experience by highlighting my transformation journey from past to present passion for innovation and computers. More information is available about the event which is open to anyone
