In several forums on digital transformations that I attended in the last two years, I would ask the panelists whether they are incorporating Generation Z millennials into their product development strategy. In such forums, you never get a "yes" or "no" answer. That is understandably ok, but the silence before saying anything makes it clear. It takes an effort to think about it when it should not be. Digital-first or mobile-first strategy should begin by clustering customers (and employees because they can influence your customers) by generation (silent gen, boomers, X, Y, and Z). Spend more research in determining differences in behavior toward your current or future products. The Z generation could ultimately drop your product altogether, so it is essential to maintain such an outlook and strategize accordingly.
