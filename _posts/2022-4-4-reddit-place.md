While we were on LinkedIn, a massive community got together and built a work of art one pixel at a time. It started as an April's Fools prank in 2017 and was revived 5 years later. Anyone in /r/place subreddit placed a pixel from a 16-bit pallet on a shared canvas. They could place another pixel only after a time-lapse between 5 to 20 minutes. 6 million users per Wikipedia participated in this year's event for four days compared to 1 million users for a single day in 2017. The result of this massive social collaboration effort is the image below. Along the process, there was lots of competition between users overriding other users' pixels and groups partnering in certain canvas places. With time and dedication, and, fortunately, no lives were lost, the Reddit generation created a massive work of digital art that is now part of the public domain.
