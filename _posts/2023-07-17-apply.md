## Greetings!

Hello there,

Exciting news! 👀 If you're an early career researcher — PhD student, postdoc, or advanced master's student — join us for a hands-on 3-day workshop focused on Large Language Models in Social Sciences. This is your chance to dive deep into NLP and expand your research horisons!

We're all about diversity and inclusivity! 🌍🤝 

> We strongly encourage applications from those identifying with underrepresented groups in academia, NLP, and tech.

### Python:
- basic concepts: objects, functions, data structures
- data processing: pandas, numpy
- deep learning frameworks: pytorch
- familiarity with jupyter notebooks UI

### Machine Learning and NLP:
- basic understanding of ML concepts: model training and evaluation stages, loss functions, metrics
- familiarity with NLP domain: embeddings, text data handling (e.g. tokenisation), familiar with classic NLP problems (e.g. text classifiction, machine translation, question answering, etc)
- basic knowledge of deep learning (gradients, backpropogation, activation functions)



Let's explore the world of large language models together! 🎉 We can't wait to see you at our workshop.
