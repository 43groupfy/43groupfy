Hello there,

👀 If you're an early career researcher — PhD student, postdoc, or advanced master's student — join us for a hands-on 3-day workshop focused on Large Language Models in Social Sciences. This is your chance to dive deep into NLP and expand your research horisons!

## Eligibility
Participation is restricted to postgraduate students, including masters, doctoral and early career researchers (within 3 years of PhD completion). We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study.

> We strongly encourage applications from those identifying with underrepresented groups in academia, NLP, and tech.

We are expecting to invite about 15 participants. You will expected to fully attend, participate and engage in the entire workshop program. 

> Sandwich lunch and refreshments (tea, coffee, buiscuts, etc.) will be provided free of cost for all participants!

Let's explore the world of large language models together! 🎉 We can't wait to see you at our workshop.

[^footnote]: We are able to fund at least five participants who will be selected by a lottery should there be more applications. We might provide additional travel grants if additional funding becomes available. All grant recipients will be notified together with the main notification on pariticipation applicaiton.
