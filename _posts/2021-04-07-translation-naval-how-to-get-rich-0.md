如何不靠运气变得富有
> How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)

By. Naval Ravikant

寻求财富，而不是金钱或地位。财富是拥有在你睡觉时能赚钱的资产。金钱是我们转移时间和财富的方式。地位是你所处的社会阶层。理解创造道德的财富是可能的。你若暗中轻视财富，财富也会远离你。忽略那些玩地位游戏的人，他们通过攻击那些玩财富创造游戏的人来获得地位。

> Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

出租你的时间不会让你变的富有。你必须拥有股权 (企业的一部分) 来获得财富自由。你可以提供社会想要但不知如何大规模获取的东西而致富。选择一个能和“长期的人”玩“长期游戏”的行业。互联网极大地扩展了职业发展的可能空间，但绝大多数人没有意识到这一点。

> You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom. You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people. The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.

玩迭代游戏。无论是财富、人际关系还是知识，生活中的所有回报都来自于复利。选择高智商、精力充沛，以及诚实高于所有其他因素的人成为商业伙伴。不要与愤世嫉俗者和悲观者为伍——他们信奉自我实现。学会销售和构建，如果两个你都能做，你将势不可挡。

> Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

用特定知识、责任感和影响力武装自己。特定知识是你不能通过培训获得的知识。如果社会能够培训你，那也能培训别人，然后替代你。特定知识是通过追寻你真正的好奇心和激情，而不是当下热点而获得的。构建特定知识对你来说就像玩一样，但对别人而言就像是工作。特定知识的传授是通过学徒制，而不是在学校。特定知识往往是高度技术性或创造性的，不能被外包或自动化。

> Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.

勇于承担责任，以自己名义承担商业风险，社会会以责任、股权和影响力来回报你。最靠得住的人有独特的、公开的和冒险性的个人品质：奥普拉(Oprah)、特朗普(Trump)、坎耶(Kanye)、埃隆(Elon)。

> Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.

“给我一根足够长的杠杆和一个立足点，我就可以撬动地球”——阿基米德。财富需要杠杆。商业杠杆来源于资本、人脉和边际成本为零的可复制产品 (程序代码和媒体媒体) 。资本意味着金钱。运用你的专业知识、责任心，并展示出良好的判断力来募集资金。劳动力是为你工作的人，这是最古老和最具争议的杠杆形式。劳动力杠杆会影响你的父母，但不要浪费你的生命来去追逐。资本和劳动力是有门槛的杠杆形式。每个人都在追逐资本，但总得有人给你；每个人都试图领导，但总得有人跟随你。代码和媒体是门槛低的杠杆形式。他们是新兴富豪们背后的杠杆。你创造的软件和媒体内容在你睡觉的时候仍能为你工作。一大群机器 (\*服务器) 可以免费使用 — — 它只是因为需要散热和太占地方而被放在数据中心，把它们用起来。如果你不会写代码，那就写书和博客，录视频和播客吧。杠杆是你判断力的强制放大器。判断力需要经验，但可以通过学习基础技能而快速构建。

> “Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” - Archimedes. Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement. Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.


没有所谓的”商业“技能，远离商业杂志和商业课程。学习微观经济学、博弈论、心理学、说服力、伦理学、数学和计算机。读比听快，做比看快。

> There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers. Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.

你应该忙得没时间“喝咖啡”(\*与朋友会面)，但仍然能够保持着完整的日程表。设置并实施一个理想的个人时薪。如果解决一个问题能够剩下的费小于你的时薪，忽略它。如果外包项目的成本低于你的时薪，那就把它外包出去！尽可能努力地工作，即使与你共事的人和工作内容都比你努力工作更加重要。在你所做的事情上做到全世界世界最好。持续重新定义你所做的事直到事实正确。

> You should be too busy to “do coffee," while still keeping an uncluttered calendar. Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.

没有快速致富的方案，那只不过是别人从你这变富罢了。将特定知识以杠杆的方式运用，最后你会得到你应得的。当你最终变得富有，你会意识到这不是你最初寻求的了，但这以后再说。

There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rich off you. Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn't what you were seeking in the first place. But that's for another day.
