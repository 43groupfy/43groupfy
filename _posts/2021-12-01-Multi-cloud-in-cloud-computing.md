**`MULTI CLOUD`**<br>

Multi-cloud is the use of two or more cloud computing services from any number of different cloud vendors. A multi-cloud environment could be all-private, all-public or a combination of both. Companies use multi-cloud environments to distribute computing resources and minimize the risk of downtime and data loss. They can also increase the computing power and storage available to a business. Innovations in the cloud in recent years have resulted in a move from single-user private clouds to multi-tenant public clouds and hybrid clouds â€” a heterogeneous environment that leverages different infrastructure environments like the private and public cloud.

`How does MULTI CLOUD look like!`<br>

As shown in the image, there would be multiple instances of cloud which would would be supplying for the resources and the computation power need to opercome the requirenemnt. Moreover because of the multiple clouds it works as the subset of distributed cloud as there are multiple cloud instances in distributed cloud but alongwith that they are also distributed in the geographic location also.

`Advantages of MULTI CLOUD?`
Although Multi cloud is advanced version and mixture of hybrid cloud and distributed cloud, there are all the advantages covered of both alongside that there are many more which are listed belop

 - Reliablity and Redundancy
 - Reduced Vender Lock In
 - Potential cost saving


`Security of MULTI CLOUD?`
Multi-cloud security has the specific challenge of protecting data in a consistent way across a variety of cloud providers. When a company uses a multi-cloud approach, third-party partners handle different aspects of security. That is why it is important in cloud deployment to clearly define and distribute security responsibilities among the parties.


Some organizations take advantage of multi-cloud capabilities to manage very large amounts of storage that is frequently accessed by a broad variety of users. For example, streaming media behemoth Netflix leverages both AWS and Google Cloud to reduce its dependency on a single provider, to take advantage of disaster recovery and business continuity services between providers, and to leverage those capabilities unique to each cloud.
