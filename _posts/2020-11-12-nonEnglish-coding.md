Software programming languages are predominantly based on the English language. The non-English part is usually some sort of localization of text and numbers. But there have been attempts to popularize some languages in non-English. Wiki has a list of those:Â <a  target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English-based_programming_languages">Non-English-based programming languages</a>. There are many reasons why such languages cannot be as popular as their English counterparts. For instance, all developers are accustomed to the common programming languages based on Latin character sets and English words. Yet, such efforts are great because they would help support the world 's different languages in today 's digital era.
