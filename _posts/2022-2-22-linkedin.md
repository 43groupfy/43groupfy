I want to share what I did with LinkedIn because it has been out of control with companies spamming my emails and phone numbers and restlessly reaching out to get any details about my employer or our employees. I deleted my entire account some time ago. I went off the grid for some time but kept my blog. It was a social media cleansing. I decided to let go of my 5k followers. I then elected to create a hidden email using Apple Id hidden-email functionality. After that, I reached out to my true friends and contacts whom I know. (My friends, please accept my apology for requesting to reconnect) I did not include my phone number during the account setup, even though LinkedIn reminded me of what I will be missing if I didn't add my phone or more emails. I did, however, put my number for 2-factor authorization. I had no other choice. I entrust LinkedIn in not sharing it. After that, I maximized every privacy setting known in the LinkedIn preferences section. Of course, the algorithm will penalize my posts because what's the purpose of a free social medium if you are maximizing privacy or not obliging with the network effect syndrome. My sense of LinkedIn is to connect with those I genuinely want to communicate with and share thoughts publicly for anyone who wishes to follow. If you happen to see this post and know each other, please connect back with me.
