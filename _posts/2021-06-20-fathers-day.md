My dad (he passed away ten years ago) was the number 1 supporter of my computer passion. I remember him signing me up to a computer club when I was seven. He later bought me my first computer, the Commodore Vic 20. That same year or the year before, he also attempted to fix my Atari game cartridge, Olympics, which I adored but was sad to see it no longer working. (The game cartridge ultimately ended up in the trash, but the thought counts..). When I was a young adult with hardly any money, he took me to buy a personal computer, and I ended up working there as my first job. I miss him. Happy Fatherâ€™s Day
