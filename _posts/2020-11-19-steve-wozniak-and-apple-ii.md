A great blog post by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/2833/why-the-apple-ii-didnt-support-lowercase-letters">“Why the Apple II Didn’t Support Lowercase Letters”</a> on <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/">vintage computing website</a>. On why the early 70s highly successful Apple II did not support lower case letters, Steve tells a larger story that reveals his ingenuity and his openness to share. Even as one of the most influential computer innovators of our time, Steve’s words are candid and transparent. It is a signature computing hackers ' mentality that has repeatedly turned passion into innovation regardless of the constraints.
