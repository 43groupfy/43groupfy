Axios article ["Americans are drowning in spam"](https://www.axios.com/spam-texts-calls-email-social-media-2af7cd73-6d7a-4f80-8026-1e5706cf3854.html) reveals that all sorts of spam, calls, texts, messages, social media, and more is increasing with no signs of slowing down. It is leading to more identity theft, ransom attacks, and more. Technology and more people embracing digital home/work environments contribute to the problem. In my opinion, no technology or government solution will solve this in the US because the American system and digital platforms encourage more interaction between strangers and less privacy. I argue that the answer to this problem is "1) control your destiny rather than resort to technology to help you with it. 2) stop wanting more and accepting more strangers as contacts. 3) set lower expectations on what social media platforms can do for you - it is more harmful than good." We tell our kids not to talk to strangers. We as adults should follow the same advice as adults. Many social media users, mainly on LinkedIn, are eager to build a more extensive strangers list of contacts they are likely to know just 1% of that list. It may make them feel more important, grant them a feeling of being a "celebrity," and probably get more media attention or job opportunities. So they find themselves struggling with the flooded messages of strangers wanting to connect when all they want is to grow the number of contacts (strangers) they have. I am not feeling "embarrassed" or less of a person with a smaller contact list after resetting my social media accounts. My action of connecting with someone is simple: only connect with who you know and want to know. Everything else is not worth the sacrifice of more spam. I think if we do more of this, we will have our human life back.
