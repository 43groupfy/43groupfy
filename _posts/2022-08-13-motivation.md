# Motivation

It's a big and small word at the same time. For some people it works and for some it doesn't. I myself was a firm believer that motivaational words/speech doesn't work. This is true even today, it's just another realization has struck in past month. Now, I believe motivational words only work on the people who wants and are willing to work on themselves. On some people it doesn't work at all like me, but, for some people it changes their life.  

I have categorized people in two categories but I agree that there might be some people who can be considered both based on the definitions and situation.

## Situation
1. **Light Situation**  
   These are the situations where the problems that people have, generally, every other person has it. It's just that the severity of the problem is low. These situation for average group of people have no difficulty navigating through with jsut a little bit of motivation or none at all. People tend to solve these problems inheriently without much thought, and they take it as a part of their journey. People don't have to beleive there is a light at the end of it.
2. **Dark Situation**  
   These are different set of problems where the situation is actually severe and any average person would struggle to deal with it. People in these situaltion doesn't seem to be able to navigate well through these situations. The problem seems so dark that not even a single ray of light is seen at the "end" of it. People doesn't even seem to believe that there is even an end at all. These situation suffocates them and makes them not having a control and motivation through these situation is extremely challanging. There is a ton of nuances that the motivating words/specch needs to tacle through.

## People
1. Dark people
   These people have extreme difficulty with any situation. Hard situation are difficult for everone but for these people even a light situation seems to be a dark one. These are the people who have suffered a lot in their life and for so long that all the hope is lost beacuse they have tried several times and failed in each attempt. They might be people with depression or one without any control of their life at all. They tend to believe that difficult problems can't be solved, it's their reality and they accept it. Acceptance is a great start to solve any problem but some motivation or willingness to solve it is also necessary. It's just that at present they are not able the ray as they seem to have any hope of it either. They might even have a belief that no one could understand their situation (highly likely to be true), and it's not worth talking about it.

3. **Light people**  
   A key characteristic of these people are self motivation. On these people, motivational words (verbal/textual) words might work or not work but the thing is they are able to navigate well through any kind of situation well be it by their self motivation, discipline or motivation from other people. In either of the case, I think it's their will to work on things that makes them a "tardigrade" [1] of landscape of different situations. These are the people who acknowledges the gravity of the situation well and are okay with it. They tend to be able to understand what's in their control and what's not and may be becuase of that they can figure out what they can do and need to do in order to try to solve the problem. They too have difficulty seeing the light at the end but I think they see something else then. I think they see the opportunity, journey of the situation.


> **Note:** People cannot be categorized into just either of the category wholly. It depends on the specifics of the situation, time and where they are. So, just understanding it itself is liberating as people (even rational) keep on jumping from one quadrant to another.

## Spectrum
Based on the above categorizations we will see people existing on this plane.

Whereever we are on this plane we need to understand ourselves and seek personal and professional help from people who we know have a best interest at heart. If we are able to understand where we are, then, we can work understanding why we are where we are, and then we should work on finding ways in ways the problem can be solved. We need to think of multiple way because we don't what might work and work on the problem with persistence and hope.


P.S: I hadn't thought that I would write this much. I thought I would just write, "Motivation is not for everyone, you have to feel motivated to get motivated" but I am happy that I did. I understand that what I have written are just words (ramble) and would be great to illustrate with example to make my words meaningful. I hope to do that in another iteration.
