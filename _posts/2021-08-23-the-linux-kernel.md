Some interesting stats about the Linux kernel (the core component of Linux rather than entire Linux-based distributions with bundled apps): it started with one developer Linus Trovalds writing ~10,000 lines of code in 1991, then it grew to around ~176,000 lines of code with community help in 1994, and now over it has 30 million lines code, 60% of those are software drivers to support new and old hardware devices, written by over 2000 engineers. Yet, the whole software development lifecycle process is still lead by Linus himself along with others. They never do it for money. Fame, maybe, but indeed not wealth. Linus and the Linux developer community is a natural living example of human relationships for a good purpose. They are certainly one of the greatest wonders of a constructive rather than destructive human world!!Â
