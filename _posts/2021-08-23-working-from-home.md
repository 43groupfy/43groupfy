Spending all day at home for work, research, and life in general with various devices (computers, phones, iPad) requires data sharing between devices if you need to keep your collected thoughts in sync. Instead of using Dropbox, One Drive, or a cloud-based solution at home, I have set up a Raspberry Pi as a Webdav server (and a Git server). I would then sync my notes using open-source Joplin on all my devices with WebDAV synchronization. That way, I keep everything encrypted, private, and easily accessible for notes and spontaneous coding thoughts. Sharing this if others can benefit from this approach.Â
