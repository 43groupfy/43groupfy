Oracle Java team released the <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/moved-by-java/timeline/">historical timeline of Java as part of Java’s 25th anniversary</a>. What I found interesting is that the Java language was first named Oak prior to 1995, but that name was already registered. Silk, Lyric, Pepper, NetProse, Neon, Ruby, WebDancer, and WebSpinner were other names that were considered. Imagine if the legendary Java was not called Java!
