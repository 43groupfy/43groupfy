Listen to the first-ever computer-generated music recorded using Turing Machine, the Marc II, by the British computer scientist Christopher Strachey with the help of Alan Turning himself in 1951. The computer filled the entire floor, and the music included: God Save the King, Baa, Baa Black Sheep, and Glenn Miller’s swing classic In the Mood. Thanks to the BBC and the British Library, the music you will hear is the oldest ever recorded or publicly accessible. The work was restored by researchers Jack Copeland and Jason Long.
