### [The scale of local news destruction in Gannett’s markets is astonishing](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/03/the-scale-of-local-news-destruction-in-gannetts-markets-is-astonishing/)

My parents got the newspaper delivered daily -- two, in fact, the Los Angeles Times and the Long Beach Press Telegram -- and when I moved out on my own, I continued to subscribe. Over time, *The Times* quality of reporting declined, but nowhere near as fast or badly as the Press. When I relocated to the Detroit area, I subscribed to the Detroit Free Press but, pre-pandemic, has already given it up. Why? Because the quality dropped, the price increased, and it was no longer worth investing in.

Unfortunately, this has been the story all across the country, with the consolidation of local newspapers occurring following mergers or outright takeovers by media mega corporations like Gannett or Alden GLobal Capital. Similar to what venture capitalists have done to grocery stores and other retail chains, papers are bought and stripped of value leading to a death spiral of decreasing subscribership following decreasing quality and local news reporting, and often an increasing slant to reporting. You may recognize a similar trend in local TV stations and news, and therein lies the problem: local newspapers and reporting are critical to fighting corruption in politics.

> When the local paper stops reporting, there’s often no one else to take its place. Everyone gets a little less informed about the world around them. And Gannett has increased local ignorance at a scale no other company can match.
