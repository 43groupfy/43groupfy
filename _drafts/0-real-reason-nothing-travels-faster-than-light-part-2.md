In [The Real Reason Nothing Travels Faster Than Light](https://booodaness.github.io/tempus-spatium/real-reason-nothing-travels-faster-than-light), we analytically proved that faster-than-light motion is logically impossible within the framework of special relativity. In doing so, we disproved the very kinematics of the situation $v>c$. This, as we discussed, is logically stronger than disproving the dynamics of the situation, i.e. the question of how such a velocity can be achieved through, say, acceleration. In this post, we will specifically look at the dynamical aspect, and how it agrees with the stronger kinematical argument.

When it comes to this topic, there are multiple layers of common misconception. The first is the supposition that disproving the dynamics also disproves the kinematics, i.e. if one can show that faster-than-light velocity cannot be achieved via any physical process, it must be theoretically impossible given the working of spacetime itself. While such an implication would be nice, it is not always true. After all, no object can be accelerated to the speed of light, and yet, light travels at, well, the speed of light! This makes sense in special relativity because things which are travelling at the speed of light cannot be accelerated in the first place, by virtue of having an invariant speed. In other words, the argument 'impossible dynamics implies impossible kinematics' implicitly assumes $v < c$, which in turn assumes that we are dealing with objects carrying positive mass. Thus, the argument fails for $v \geq c$ and we are forced to base kinematical arguments solely on the kinematics as opposed to the dynamics.

The second layer of popular misconception is the notion that theoretically, one would strictly need infinite energy to accelerate a body of positive mass from $v<c$ to $v = c$. It turns out that this is not true! In general, a body would need to convert all its mass to relativistic kinetic energy in order to approach the speed of light â€” but that means it would cease to exist as matter by the time it reaches the speed of light! [^1]

[^1]: However, it is true that if the body were to be accelerated to the speed of light _without_ a change in its mass, it would require infinite energy. However, this case leaves out the possibility of the body propelling itself, which does not necessarily involve infinite energy.

## Propulsion

### Relativistic Tsiolkovsky rocket equation

An ideal relativistic model can be modelled in the following manner:

1. It gains 3-speed by losing mass continuously with a 3-speed $u$ in its frame.

2. The above gain in velocity happens due to the conservation of total 4-momentum of the rocket and expelled mass.
