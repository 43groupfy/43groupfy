### [Major Version Numbers are Not Sacred](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2022/05/23/major-version-numbers-are-not-sacred.html)

Assuming you use any sort of libraries in your projects, you're probably exposed to *semantic versioning* (SemVer) almost every day. Chances are good, too, that you've run into a breaking change in something that didn't have a major revision. [SemVer is pretty well-defined in how it's meant to work](https://semver.org), so *why* does this happen? Chances are it has something to do with marketing and the practice of major revisions corresponding to big product releases.

We need to get away from this practice because a breaking change in SemVer *requires* a major revision change -- it's part of the common understanding. Not following the standard for *reasons* breaks the contract and frustrates consumers. This post from [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo/), creator of SemVer, does a great job of explaining the why's and how's of SemVer, as well as solutions for decoupling marketing from versioning. Definitely worth a read.

> I want to live in a world where every breaking change comes gift-wrapped in a major release. I want the promise of SemVer to be fully realized. I think we can get there by rejecting the tyranny of sacred major version numbers. If you feel the same, I hope youâ€™ll join me in embracing this philosophy.
